Sometimes you have to do what it takes to reach your dreams, and i'm always looking for my own way, a dream that has printed itself when i saw a lot of movies about programming. I hope, I wish and now I pray that i can achieve my dream. I studied Mecanic and I had my diploma, but I always feel something lost. After that, I recognized that even that field need technology, which is why I improved my program knowledge. In fact, I master html, css, python and JavaScript. I love reading books while listening to calm music, also i like traveling to exchange cultures and discover the world. I can speak Arabic, French and English. And for your information, I am an enthusiastic and wise person, so I am resolved to reach my dream. Thanks for my life experiences that makes me stronger and gave me : sense of organization, team spirit and motivation.",
